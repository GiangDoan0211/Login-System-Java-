# ExamApp-Swing

This is the Exam App using Swing

This app includes the following functions:
1. Login/Register system:
   - You can login/register account
   - It has account and password checking feature.
   - If you enter the wrong password 5 times, the app will freeze for 5 seconds
2. Login as root:
   - manage the application
   - add/delete user
   - show list of account
   - show application
   - Lock/Unlock user   
3. The Exam Test
4. While you're in Exam, you cannot exit the app. Just finish and it will close.
5. Anti cheat: When you minimize the app; alt + tab; click outside, a message will pop up saying you have cheated. 

THIS IS JUST A TEST VERSION. I JUST LEARNED PROGRAMMING SO THE APP LOOKS A BIT UGLY. SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH =))
